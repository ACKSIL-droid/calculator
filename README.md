# Qalculator!

### [A syllabus project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) fullstack web-dev course

An elaborate modelling of the functions and behaviour of the classic CASIO HL-100LB pocket calculator, right down to the slight LCD flicker of the screen on input.

Click on any keypad button to begin calculating, or input from your numpad. Operations are ordered as they would be for an old-school pocket calculator; hitting a new operator will complete the prior operation, while ± and √ keys affect the current input. Use M+, M- and MRC to access memory functions.
